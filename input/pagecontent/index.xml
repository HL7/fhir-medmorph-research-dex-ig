  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    The Making Electronic Data More Available for Research and Public Health (MedMorph) project seeks to advance public health and patient-centered outcomes 
		by using emerging health data and exchange standards, such as Health Level 7 (HL7<sup>®</sup>) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR<sup>®</sup>) and 
	Clinical Quality Language (CQL), to develop and implement an interoperable solution that will enable access to clinical data. The MedMorph project 
	fits within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strategic imperative of transforming how data are collected, used, and shared 
	through modern Information Technology (IT) capabilities to save lives and improve health. The initial phase of the MedMorph project was funded by the Health and 
	Human Services (HHS) Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) and 
	executed by the Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services (CSELS) Public Health Informatics Office (PHIO) to 
	advance research and public health goals.
    </p>
    <p>   
    The project aims to leverage the maturation of standards and requirements for certification of health IT by the Office of the 
	National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) that underpin many electronic health records (EHRs). Examples such as FHIR<sup>®</sup>, the ONC 2015 Edition 
	Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS), 2015 Edition Cures Update - United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Version 1, February 2020, and 
	standardized application programming interfaces (API) for patient services have created a health IT environment that is ripe for developing 
	standards-based scalable and extensible solutions to overcome interoperability challenges.

    This MedMorph Research Data Exchange Implementation Guide (IG) will specify how the [MedMorph Reference Architecture (RA) IG]({{site.data.fhir.ver.medmorphIg}}/index.html) can be leveraged to
    enable data access for research purposes as documented in the <a href="usecases.html">Use Cases</a>.

	<h3>Technical Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The main sections of this IG are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="usecases.html">Use Cases</a> - The use cases provide business context and information that implementers should be
      familiar with before reading the remainder of the IG.  
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="spec.html">Detailed Specification</a> - The formal specification identifying the requirements for the implementers.
    </li>
